       <p> As I was a participant of Study Abroad program in South Korea, I started my own YouTube channel in which I was talking about my personal experiences in Seoul, capital of South Korea. There are four videos on my YouTube channel! first video is posted on this page and is all about my experience in Self-Isolation. As you may know, upon arrival to South Korea, it is mandatory to self-isolate for 2 weeks and the government is paying a lot of attention to the people in quarantine. I found this information interesting and made a video about my expenses and experience in quarantine. After this video I posted few travel vlogs around Seoul and Busan. If you would like to know more about my YouTube channel please open this link and enjoy the content I made as a beginner in editing and vlogging </p>
